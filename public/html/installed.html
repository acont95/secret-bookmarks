      Welcome to Secret Bookmarks! This extension provides the ability to password encrypt the bookmark entries inside of a bookmark folder. 
    </p>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Make a Backup</strong>
        <p>
          Using your browsers Bookmark Manager, export your bookmarks to ensure your data is protected before proceeding.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Access the Extension</strong>
        <p>
          Secret Bookmarks is accessed by default from the navigation bar alongside the URL Bar
          using the 
          <img class="book-svg-icon" src="/public/images/book-lock-outline.svg" alt="Icon" width="24" height="24" />
          icon.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Encrypt a Folder</strong>
        <p>
          Your bookmark folder hierarchy is listed in the popup panel. To encrypt a folder toggle the slider next to the folder name
          and set a password.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Decrypt a Folder</strong>
        <p>
          To decrypt a bookmarks folder, select Secret Bookmarks in the naviagtion bar and toggle the slider
          next to the the encrypted folder. You will be prompted for your password.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Backup Encryption Details</strong>
        <p>
          The recommended method of backing up your bookmarks is to periodically export your unencrypted
          bookmarks using the browsers bookmarks manager. In addition, Secret Bookmarks provides the ability to export 
          encryption details of your managed folders to a text file. This file can be imported to restore settings, but 
          note that current bookmark folders settings will be overwritten by the imported data if the same folder is referenced.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add or Move a Bookmarks</strong>
        <p>
          Adding or moving an existing bookmark to a managed folder will automatically encrypt the bookmark
          if the folder is currently locked. Removing an encrypted bookmark from a managed folder will NOT
          prompt for the password and decrypt the bookmark.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change a Folders Passphrase</strong>
        <p>
          Select the  
          <img class="gear-svg-icon" src="/public/images/gear-svgrepo-com.svg" alt="Icon" width="24" height="24" />
          icon, enter your current password and a new password then select submit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Delete a Folders Encryption Keys</strong>
        <p>
          Select the  
          <img class="trash-svg-icon" src="/public/images/trash-svgrepo-com.svg" alt="Icon" width="24" height="24" />
          icon, enter your current password and select Delete Keys.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Applicable Bookmark Entries</strong>
        <p>
          Secret Bookmarks uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Schemes/data" target="_blank">Data URLs</a> 
          to store the base64 encrypted bookmark URL. The extension uses the presence/absence of a data URL to determine if a bookmark is already
          encrypted and when to decrypt a bookmark. As a result of this implementation detail, user supplied data URLs bookmarks
          are not supported with this extension and may cause undefined behavior. In addition, moving an encrypted bookmark from one folder 
          to another encrypted folder will cause decryption failures.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Extension Settings</strong>
        <p>
          Secret Bookmarks will use sync storage if available to synchronize encryption details, otherwise storage will fallback 
          to local storage. When using sync storage, keep in mind adding a bookmark to an encrypted folder on a device without
          Secret Bookmarks installed may result in unencrypted bookmarks existing alonside encyrpted bookmarks in a folder believed to 
          be in a locked state. You may need to decrypt then encrypt the folder again to ensure all bookmark entries are encrypted.
